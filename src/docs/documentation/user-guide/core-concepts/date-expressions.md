#Date Expressions

In order to save your precious time while doing your work, MixERP provides you with an unique ability to quickly enter Dates into the application by entering simple alphabetical expressions. This means that for the most part you might not have to type/select the whole date.

For example if you want to enter today's date simply type _"d"_ and hit TAB , MixERP will automatically enter today's date. 
If you want to enter yesterday's date just type in _"-d"_.
Similarly, enter _+d_ for tomorrow's date or _"2d"_ if you want to enter the date of day after tomorrow.

List of all the expressions applicable.
