#Tax Exempt Types

A sales transaction can be subject to tax exemption based on:

* Type of Customer
* Type of Item Being Sold

Sometimes, a business may directly be entitled to tax exemptions, thus making them eligible to lower tax rates
or even no tax at all. It is, therefore, convenient to create exemption types in MixERP beforehand.
