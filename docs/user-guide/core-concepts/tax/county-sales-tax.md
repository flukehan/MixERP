#County Sales Taxes

In United States and some other countries, there are several federal taxes including the county sales tax. A
sales tax can differ from one county to the other. Similarly, a county sales tax can have different rates based
on:

* Type of Customer (Establishment/Corporation/Entity)
* Type of Customer (Industry)
* Type of Item
* Any combination of the above three.
